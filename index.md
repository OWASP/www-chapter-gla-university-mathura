## Welcome
At **GLA University, Mathura**, We have taken the initiative to develop a **Strong culture** for Cyber Security. We present to you the **OWASP Student Chapter** to help students _develop their Technical skills while also strengthening web security_. 



## Participation
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our projects ,tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. 

* Chapters are led by local leaders in accordance with the [Chapters Policy](/www-policy/operational/chapters).

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate in our **Projects, Events and Activities**. We especially encourage diversity in all our initiatives. OWASP is a fantastic place to learn about application security, to network, and even to build your reputation as an expert.
